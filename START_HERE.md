# ⚡ QUICK START - Deploy Now!

## 🔴 Step 1: Fix Git PATH (Do This First!)

**Your Git is installed but terminal can't see it yet.**

### Quick Fix:
1. **Close VS Code completely** (File → Exit)
2. **Reopen VS Code**
3. **Open new terminal** (`Ctrl + ~`)
4. Test: `git --version` (should work now!)

## ✅ Step 2: Tell Me When Ready!

Once you see Git version output, come back and say:

**"Git is working"**

Then I'll guide you through these steps:

1. ✅ Configure Git (30 seconds)
2. ✅ Initialize repository (30 seconds)
3. ✅ Push to GitHub (2 minutes)
4. ✅ Setup Supabase (5 minutes)  
5. ✅ Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)
6. ✅ Run migrations (3 minutes)
7. ✅ Go live! (2 minutes)

**Total time: ~20 minutes** (once Git is working)
